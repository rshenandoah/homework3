"Ellery, tell me a joke."
"Why did the cat cross the playground?"
"Why?"
"To get to the other slide."

"I need another one."
"How do you make a milk shake?"
"How?"
"Give a cow a pogo stick."

"Time for another one."
"Another? Let me think. . ." Time passes. "What is black and white and red all over?"
"I dunno."
"A newspaper."
